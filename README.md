# usm-acm-ieee

USM ACM-IEEE is the combination of two separate organizations, under one roof. We acted as two separate entities for years before 
realizing that our goals were the exact same, to benefit student and build outstanding contacts around them. So in 2019 we decided to 
combine our efforts for the betterment of the Students! We host tutorials every week. Topics range in variety but they are topics not 
currently taught in class. Topics covered in the past have been: Ruby on Rails, Javascript, ICPC Prep, Pentesting, and Unity Game 
Development.
